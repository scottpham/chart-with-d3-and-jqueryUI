I'm learnng D3.js. This is a vertical bar chart using the basic bar chart tutorials and a JQuery UI slider.

This chart appeared alongside [this NBC Bay Area](http://www.nbcbayarea.com/investigations/Bay-Area-Police-Miss-as-Much-as-20-of-Traffic-Trials-sjpd-speeding-tickets-262592831.html) story.


San Jose CHP had such a large value that it left a lot of the smaller entries difficult to see.  So I implemented a jquery ui slider thanks to the examples from [this SO post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12848181/d3-simple-linear-chart-with-jquery-ui-range-slider).
