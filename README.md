This is a vertical bar chart using [Mike Bostock's grouped bar chart example](http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/3887051) and a JQuery UI slider.

One of my data points had such a large value that it was hard to see the smaller points without logging the x axis. So I implemented a JWuery UI slider using examples from [this Stack Overflow Post](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12848181/d3-simple-linear-chart-with-jquery-ui-range-slider). 

The chart appeared alongside [this NBC Bay Area](http://www.nbcbayarea.com/investigations/Bay-Area-Police-Miss-as-Much-as-20-of-Traffic-Trials-sjpd-speeding-tickets-262592831.html) story.
